# Fixing Blank Screen Issues in PeakHub

## What Causes Blank Screens?

Blank screens in React applications typically occur when:

1. **Rendering Errors**: A JavaScript error occurs during rendering but doesn't show an error message
2. **Module Loading Issues**: Problems importing components or dependencies
3. **Router Configuration**: Missing or incorrectly configured routes
4. **Context Providers**: Errors in context providers like AuthProvider
5. **Mock Servers**: Issues with mock API servers like MirageJS

## Our Specific Solution

In our PeakHub app, we found that the blank screen issues could be resolved by:

1. **Simplifying the App**: Temporarily replacing the complex app with a minimal test component
2. **Disabling MirageJS**: Commenting out the MirageJS mock server initialization
3. **Gradual Re-integration**: Adding back components one at a time to identify the problematic one
4. **Fixing React Router**: Ensuring all routes are properly configured

## Step-by-Step Fix Process

When you encounter a blank screen:

1. **Access the Test Page**: Go to `/test` which renders our minimal TestPage component
2. **Check Browser Console**: Open developer tools (F12) and check for errors
3. **Disable Complex Components**: If needed, comment out complex components in App.tsx
4. **Verify Routes Work**: Make sure each route is properly defined
5. **Check Context Providers**: Ensure AuthProvider and other contexts are working

## Prevention Tips

1. **Add Test Route**: Always keep a `/test` route with a simple component for debugging
2. **Use Console Logs**: Add console.log statements to track component rendering
3. **Add New Pages Incrementally**: When adding new pages, test each step
4. **Check Dependencies**: Make sure all required dependencies are installed

## Common Issues in Our Codebase

1. **Styling Issues**: Tailwind classes sometimes don't apply correctly
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Fix type issues in components like ErrorBoundary
3. **Mirage & Auth Provider**: These can sometimes conflict
4. **Complex Home Page**: The Home component has many dependencies that can cause issues

## Immediate Fix

If you need an immediate fix:

1. Open App.tsx
2. Navigate to `/test` instead of the home page
3. Gradually re-enable routes and components
